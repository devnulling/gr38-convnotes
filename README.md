My Notes for Converting GNU Radio 3.7 OOT modules to 3.8

This is a collection of notes on finally successfully converting GNURadio OOT modules from 3.7 to 3.8.  I also include a setup script for Ubuntu 18 that installs GNU Radio 3.8 from the respective sources with versions of what I call standard modules for my installs including a ported OSMOSDR ported to 3.8. 

NOTE: The included install scripts have only been tested on Ubuntu 18 with any other GNU Radio versions removed first.  One script does complete install direct from source, and the other leverages pybombs as much as possible.
